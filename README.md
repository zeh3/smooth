graphing UIUC's new coronavirus case and positivity rate data using rolling averages (except for the cumulative cases graph. that one is not averaged)

data downloaded [from the UIUC testing dashboard](https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData)

day 0 is either the first or seventh day of testing, depending on how you want to think about rolling averages (the graph only starts once enough data has been collected to calculate a 7 day rolling average)
